# design:

## 1. User can add a block of text thru web gui or drop a txt file there:
- text form - implemented
- tetxt file - yet TODO\
features:
1. max size is 10mb - TODO,
1. user can set time of life of this content - done:\
    Additional features:
    - time till expiry can be seen in real time when user read the paste.
1. user can add password to a block - TODO
1. user can sign up his text

## 2. User get in return a relative URL (I use simply unique HASH generated by my hashing server)
## 3. Such url can be used to access the metadata in the db
## 4. Db stores these urls along with some more metadate
## 5. I use s3 storage to store the paste (text) itself, the key to the text is combination of its url and timestamp (and the actual password if it was specified.)
## Hashing server: 
1. urls are unique 
1. and implement CASHING for popular urls (redis) - TODO
1. also implement multithreading - TODO
## redis:
redis will store just most popular pastes 
### cache design idea: 
* the redis cache stores key-accesses pair as a set
* if key is not on the cash:
* it is pulled from the db and its accesses counter gets increased
*  flush the cache every N seconds and refill it with M most popular keys

## 6. Make html page for urls that are already expired (and maybe return these urls to the pool)-TODO
